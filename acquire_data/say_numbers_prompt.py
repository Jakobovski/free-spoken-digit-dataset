"""
Prompts you to say numbers. 

Start this, and then hit "Record" in Audacity. 
http://www.audacityteam.org/download/

Takes about 30 minutes to record a full dataset.

Tips:
- Turn off your screen saver before you start!
- Try a short recording session first to make sure everything works OK before doing the full recording.

When done, export the audio as one big .wav file and use 'split_and_label_numbers.py' 
to make the labeled dataset.
